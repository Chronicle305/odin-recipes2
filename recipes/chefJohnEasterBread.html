        <p>If you were lucky enough to grow up in an Italian-American home, there's a good chance you got to enjoy the smell of freshly baked Easter bread, with its unmistakable anisette aroma filling the air. This loaf of Easter bread is one of my favorite holiday traditions, and an authentic family heirloom recipe; made the same way as my mother, and her mother, and her mother's mother made it. I hope you give this a try, and remember, it's never too late to start an old family tradition. Frost with pink icing and top with sprinkles!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <Ul>
        <li>

            1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
        </li>
        <li>

            ½ teaspoon white sugar
        </li>
        <li>

            ¼ cup warm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C)
        </li>
        <li>

            ¾ cup white sugar
        </li>
        <li>

            4 eggs
        </li>
        <li>

            2 tablespoons vegetable oil
        </li>
        <li>

            1 ½ tablespoons anise extract
        </li>
        <li>

            1 tablespoon lemon zest
        </li>
        <li>

            1 ½ teaspoons lemon extract
        </li>
        <li>

            1 ¼ teaspoons salt
        </li>
        <li>

            1 teaspoon anise seed
        </li>
        <li>

            6 tablespoons melted butter
        </li>
        <li>

            ¼ cup milk
        </li>
        <li>

            4 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided
        </li>
    </Ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move the oven rack to the center position. </li><br>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside. </li><br>
        <li>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. </li><br>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes. </li><br>
        <li> Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring. </li><br>
        <li>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness. </li><br>
        <li>Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs. </li>
    </ol>
