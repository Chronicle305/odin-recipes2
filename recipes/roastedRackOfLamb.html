    <p>A rack of lamb is topped with a herby crust before it's roasted. I have been using this recipe for a long time,
        and enjoy making it for special occasions. The lamb always comes out juicy and tender. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

            ½ cup fresh bread crumbs
        </li>
        <li>

            2 tablespoons minced garlic
        </li>
        <li>

            2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
        </li>
        <li>

            1 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>

            ¼ teaspoon black pepper
        </li>
        <li>

            2 tablespoons olive oil
        </li>
        <li>

            1 (7 bone) rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched
        </li>
        <li>

            1 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>

            1 teaspoon black pepper
        </li>
        <li>

            2 tablespoons olive oil
        </li>
        <li>

            1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move the oven rack to the center position. </li><br>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside. </li><br>
        <li>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. </li><br>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes. </li><br>
        <li>Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring. </li><br>
        <li>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness. </li><br>
        <li>Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs. </li>
    </ol>
